# Who I Am

DevSecOps Engineer with a focus on secure automation, stable deployments, and observable systems. Experience includes over **4 years in network engineering** and **1+ year in DevSecOps**, bridging traditional operations with modern, cloud-native security practices. Advocate for **open-source** and **vendor-neutral** solutions that promote **flexibility**, **scalability**, and **long-term maintainability**.

---

## Technical Core

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Helm Charts  
- **CI/CD & Security**: GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, GitOps workflows, Secrets Management  
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (K8s), Docker Swarm  
- **Observability & Monitoring**: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Elastic Stack, Uptime Kuma  
- **Automation & Scripting**: Bash, Python  
- **Data Systems**: PostgreSQL tuning, RabbitMQ  
- **Linux & Cloud Ops**: Bare-metal, hybrid, and cloud system administration  
- **Security Practices**: Vulnerability scanning, hardening, zero-trust principles  

---

## Recent Work

- Replaced proprietary monitoring with **Prometheus + Alertmanager**, reducing alert fatigue by **35%**  
- Automated Elastic Stack deployments using **Helm Charts**, streamlining cluster-wide logging  
- Deployed **Uptime Kuma** for synthetic monitoring â€” achieving **99.95% uptime**  
- Managed **PostgreSQL clusters** with streaming replication for high-availability workloads  
- Orchestrated hybrid container deployments via **Kubernetes** and **Docker Swarm**  
- Built and maintained robust **CI/CD pipelines** with GitLab and Jenkins, cutting deployment errors significantly  
- Integrated **security scanning** into CI/CD pipelines, improving compliance and reducing vulnerabilities

## Engineering Philosophy

- Security and automation go hand in hand  
- Open-source > vendor lock-in  
- Design for failure and self-healing  
- Documentation should be written so anyone can troubleshoot at 3 AM  

---

## Currently Exploring

- **K3s** for lightweight Kubernetes clusters  
- **eBPF** for deep observability and performance tuning  
- **Zero-downtime DB migrations** and **canary deployments**  
- Advanced **DevSecOps practices** at the intersection of **security**, **automation**, and **scale**
