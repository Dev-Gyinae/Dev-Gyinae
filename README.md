# üëã Who I Be?

I'm an **Infrastructure Engineer** focused on stable deployments, observable systems, and resilient data pipelines. With over **4 years in network engineering** and **1+ year in DevOps**, I bridge traditional operations with modern, cloud-native tooling.

I advocate for **open-source**, **vendor-neutral** solutions that promote **flexibility**, **scalability**, and **long-term maintainability**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Core

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Helm Charts  
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, GitOps workflows  
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (K8s), Docker Swarm  
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Elastic Stack, Uptime Kuma  
- **Automation & Scripting**: Bash, Python  
- **Data Systems**: PostgreSQL tuning, RabbitMQ  
- **Linux Ops**: Bare-metal & cloud system administration

## üöÄ Recent Wins

- Replaced proprietary monitoring with **Prometheus + Alertmanager**, reducing alert fatigue by **35%**
- Automated Elastic Stack deployments using **Helm Charts**, streamlining cluster-wide logging
- Deployed **Uptime Kuma** for synthetic monitoring ‚Äî achieving **99.95% uptime**
- Managed **PostgreSQL clusters** with streaming replication for high-availability workloads
- Orchestrated hybrid container deployments via **Kubernetes** and **Docker Swarm**
- Built and maintained robust **CI/CD pipelines** with GitLab and Jenkins, cutting deployment errors significantly

## üß† Engineering Philosophy

- Open-source > vendor lock-in  
- Design for failure and self-healing  
- Write documentation like someone else will troubleshoot it at 3 AM

## üîç Currently Exploring

- **K3s** for lightweight Kubernetes clusters  
- **eBPF** for deep observability and performance tuning  
- **Zero-downtime DB migrations** and **canary deployments**  
- Challenging infrastructure problems at the intersection of **automation**, **scale**, and **resilience**
