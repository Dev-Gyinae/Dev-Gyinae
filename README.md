# 💫 Who I be?:
Infrastructure engineer focused on stable deployments, observable systems, and data resilience. With over 2 years of DevOps practice and 4 years in network engineering, I bridge traditional operations with cloud-native tooling. I prefer open-source, vendor-neutral solutions that promote flexibility, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

Technical Core:
✓ Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Helm Charts
✓ CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, GitOps workflows
✓ Container Orchestration: Kubernetes (k8s), Docker Swarm
✓ Observability: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Elastic Stack, Uptime Kuma
✓ Scripting & Automation: Bash, Python
✓ Data Systems: PostgreSQL optimization, RabbitMQ
✓ Linux Systems: Bare-metal and cloud administration

Recent Impact:
✓ Replaced proprietary monitoring with Prometheus and Alertmanager, reducing alert fatigue by 35 percent
✓ Automated Elastic Stack deployments using Helm Charts to streamline log analysis at scale
✓ Deployed Uptime Kuma for continuous synthetic monitoring of critical APIs, achieving 99.95 percent uptime
✓ Maintained PostgreSQL clusters with streaming replication for high-availability workloads
✓ Managed hybrid container deployments across Kubernetes and Docker Swarm environments
✓ Built and maintained GitLab and Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, accelerating deployment cycles and reducing errors

Engineering Philosophy:
✓ Prefer open-source tools over vendor lock-in
✓ Build systems that fail gracefully and heal automatically
✓ Write documentation like someone else will troubleshoot it at 3 AM

Currently Exploring: 
✓ K3s for lightweight Kubernetes environments
✓ eBPF for advanced observability and performance monitoring
✓ Zero-downtime database migrations and canary deployments
✓ Open to infrastructure challenges where automation, scalability, and resilience intersect
