# Samuel Gyinae

DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience building, automating, and operating cloud-native infrastructure for telecom and fintech platforms supporting 100k+ users.

I specialize in infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and observability across AWS, Azure, and OCI. My background in networking and cloud security enables me to design systems that are reliable, secure, and audit-ready.

I have supported production and staging environments for MTN group platforms and contributed to cloud connectivity, identity access management, and PCI-DSS readiness for fintech systems at Hubtel.

## What I Work On

- Designing and operating CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps  
- Automating infrastructure using Terraform, CloudFormation, and Ansible  
- Deploying and managing containerized workloads with Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and Docker Swarm  
- Implementing monitoring and observability with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, and alerting systems  
- Applying DevSecOps practices such as vulnerability scanning, RBAC, and secure defaults without slowing delivery

## Core Experience Highlights

- Reduced environment provisioning and recovery time by approximately 40% through Infrastructure as Code  
- Supported CI/CD release processes and uptime management for telecom platforms serving 100k+ users  
- Operated Linux-based production systems with a focus on reliability, rollback safety, and incident response  
- Supported PCI-DSS compliance initiatives and Azure AD / Entra ID access control  
- Improved incident detection and response times by 25–30% through observability tooling

## Selected Projects (Personal – GitHub)

### Cloud Infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation
Reusable CloudFormation templates for provisioning VPCs, EC2 instances, IAM roles, security groups, and networking components following AWS best practices.

### Secure CI/CD Pipeline
Production-style GitLab CI pipeline integrating Docker, Trivy, SonarQube, and Kubernetes to automate build, test, scan, and deployment stages.

### Kubernetes Monitoring and Observability Stack
Automated deployment of Prometheus and Grafana using Helm, including dashboards and alerting for real-time system visibility.

These projects reflect production patterns and mirror tooling used in real client environments.
